# Refurbished-Car-Price-Prediction
Developed a linear regression model to predict refurbished car prices and provided actionable insights

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the prices of refurbished cars based on various features such as brand, model, manufacturing year, mileage, and other relevant factors. Accurate predictions can help both buyers and sellers in the second-hand car market make informed decisions.

## Key Features
- Data collection and preprocessing from available car listings.
- Feature engineering to enhance the predictive power of the dataset.
- Model training and evaluation using machine learning algorithms.
- Visualization of data trends and model results.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Machine Learning Models:** Regression models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about:
- Car brand and model
- Manufacturing year
- Mileage
- Engine type
- Fuel type
- Transmission
- Price (target variable)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Import and clean the dataset.
2. **EDA:** Analyze patterns and relationships between features.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and normalize numerical features.
4. **Model Building:** Train multiple regression models and select the best-performing one.
5. **Model Evaluation:** Measure performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Results
- Best model achieved [insert performance metric, e.g., RMSE of 1500] on the test set.
- Visualizations provided insights into key factors affecting car prices.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rajadeepa/refurbished-car-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to view the model development process.

## Future Improvements
- Incorporate more features such as seller rating and location.
- Explore deep learning models for better prediction accuracy.
- Develop a web-based application for users.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to predict refurbished car prices effectively, providing valuable insights for stakeholders in the second-hand car market.
